tund_001lr_200ep_0.9moment 0.09636 w/o reflection and subpatch of test image, 200 epochs, would try 250 epochs next time
tund_001lr_250ep_0.9moment 0.09600 extend to 250 epoches from the above one, would try five crop next time
tund_001lr_250ep_0.9moment 0.19906 the same trained model as above, first time test with five crop
tund_001lr_250ep_0.9moment 0.18366 the same trained model as above, scale test data to size of 180 before crop
tund_001lr_250ep_0.9moment 0.16699 the same trained model as above, change mean between five crops to max
tund_001lr_250ep_0.9moment 0.10855 the same trained model as above, add normalize in val_transforms
tund_001lr_250ep_0.9moment 0.11002 the same trained model as above, ten crop
tund_001lr_5crop_250ep_0.9moment 0.11260 changes in data_transforms, would try flip and rotate next time
tund_001lr_5crop_250ep_0.9moment_nocrop 0.08786 no crop with above data_transforms
tund_001lr_5crop_250ep_0.9moment_crop 0.11260 same with above 11260 just split eval.py into crop and no crop
